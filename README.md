## üîç **Overview**
Predicting product prices is a challenging task due to the variability and complexity of textual descriptions. Using a dataset of **400,000 data points**, this project explores a variety of models and techniques to deliver accurate price predictions.  

Key highlights:
- Fine-tuning large language models like **LLaMA 3.1** with **LoRA/QLoRA**.
- Experimenting with traditional machine learning models such as **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression**.
- Leveraging **state-of-the-art AI models** like GPT-40 and its mini versions.
- Tracking and visualizing experiments with **Weights & Biases (W&B)**.
